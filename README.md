# SQL-Project
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

For this project, the goal was to help develop the launch strategy for the new online video service, 
using data-related from existing rental data queries. The project began with loading the company’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer several business questions.
